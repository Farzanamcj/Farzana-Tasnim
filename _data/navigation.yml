## âœ¨ A Tiny Zine!

![Cover image of the zine, A Tiny Zine](../assets/files/A4_myZine_Aladdin.pdf)

This micro-zine reimagines the story of *Aladdin* through a playful and minimalist lens. It experiments with visual abstraction and constrained space to distill a classic tale into a compact artistic artifact.

Created using a single-page foldable format, the zine combines illustration, symbolism, and alternative page structure to explore the boundaries of storytelling and remix culture. The project is presented in its original form as part of the final portfolio submission.
