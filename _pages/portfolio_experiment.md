    <em>A Tiny Zine</em> reimagines the story of <strong>Aladdin</strong> through a playful and minimalist lens. It experiments with visual abstraction, metaphor, and the constraints of the single-sheet zine format to distill a well-known tale into a compact yet evocative artifact.

    Crafted using folded paper and black & white visuals, this piece relies on abstraction and minimalist storytelling to evoke themes of magic, transformation, and self-discovery. It aims to challenge our expectations of both medium and narrative through visual design and spatial play.
