title: "🪞 Becoming a Maker-Scholar: A Reflection"
author_profile: true
---

This semester has marked a transformative shift in how I understand scholarship, storytelling, and digital creativity. As someone grounded in academic research, pedagogy, and media theory, I have always approached knowledge-making through critical analysis. But this course has allowed me to explore a different register—**making as a mode of knowing**, storytelling as a method of inquiry, and digital experimentation as a form of feminist praxis.

## 🌱 From Researcher to Maker

I entered this course identifying primarily as a researcher and educator. Through the experiments in interactive storytelling, I discovered the generative friction between code and creativity, structure and affect, interface and intimacy. I began to see myself not only as a scholar but as a **maker-scholar**—someone who thinks through design, builds with intention, and experiments with meaning.

In both of my portfolio projects, this shift became tangible:

- **Dust in the Floorboards**, my Bitsy-based game poem, was an exercise in narrative restraint and spatial memory. Here, interactivity is affective—players move through a home once lived in, now only remembered. The minimalist tools of Bitsy helped me reflect on how little it takes to evoke loss and belonging, and how spatial design can be emotional storytelling.
  
- **A Tiny Zine (Aladdin Reimagined)**, a micro-publication that plays with form and format, allowed me to experiment with narrative remix and layout. This zine reimagines the story of *Aladdin* through a critical, poetic lens, challenging colonial and orientalist framings of the original tale. Creating a zine reminded me of the power of print-based storytelling in an increasingly digital world, and how remix culture offers space for resistance and reimagination.

## 🧵 Making, Meaning, and Media

One of the most valuable lessons I learned this term is that **making is not separate from theorizing—it is theory in practice**. Whether through branching dialogue, pixel art, or sentiment scores, each project became a site of inquiry and imagination. They are not just assignments—they are arguments, interventions, and invitations.

This course also reminded me that **making is relational**. It’s not just about individual creativity but about community, feedback, vulnerability, and collaboration. I’m grateful for the experimental spirit of this class and for the shared journey with peers who inspired me with their unique voices.

## 💭 Looking Forward

This final portfolio is a snapshot of where I am now as a maker-scholar—but it also points forward. I want to continue combining research with creative expression, and I hope to develop future projects that:
- Use interactive media to tell feminist and postcolonial stories,
- Leverage data as both a critique and a creative medium,
- Create participatory, affective experiences that challenge dominant narratives.

I now see “critical making” as a methodological stance: one that is political, poetic, and personal.
