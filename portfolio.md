  <p>
    <em>A Tiny Zine!</em> reimagines the story of <strong>Aladdin</strong> through a playful and minimalist lens. It experiments with visual abstraction, metaphor, and the constraints of the single-sheet zine format to distill a well-known tale into a compact yet evocative artifact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Crafted using folded paper and black & white visuals, this piece relies on abstraction and minimalist storytelling to evoke themes of magic, transformation, and self-discovery. It aims to challenge our expectations of both medium and narrative through visual design and spatial play.

    This is the original version submitted as one of two final portfolio projects.

<p>
  This interactive project proposal, built using Twine, outlines a plan to create a digital portfolio on GitHub Pages. The enhanced version introduces an embedded <strong>YouTube tutorial</strong> to guide beginners, improving accessibility and educational value.
</p>
<p>
  Expanded and refined beyond the original version, this Twine project now includes:
  - An embedded multimedia experience (video tutorial)
  - Reorganized branching structure for better flow
  - A more immersive, interactive narrative to present the portfolio plan
</p>
<p>
  This project fully meets the <strong>bolstering</strong> criteriaâ€”by adding new media, enhancing user interaction, and reimagining the form to offer a more engaging and complete experience.
